  <h1>OddFrames.jl</h1>
  <h2>A lightweight approach to working with data</h2>
<p>OddFrames.jl is a new kind of data management and manipulation package for Julia. Whereas many of the packages similar to OddFrames rely heavily on the Julia ecosystem, this creates many problems with speed and pre-compiling. A data management platform does not need an entire ecosystem of tools behind it. This of course is not to insult that methodology, but just to prove the point that OddFrames.jl is in fact usable. These frames are made to be easy to use, a mix-up of Pandas/Python calls and Julian calls, and very fast. If you are coming from Python's Pandas, this is certainly the package for you! </p>
