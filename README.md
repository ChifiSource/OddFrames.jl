  **OddStructures.jl** Is a core odd data package that defines the base Data-types, as well as some methods associated with those Data-types and exports them all for convenience. This is to be used primarily with the module [**OddFrames.jl**](), so if that is really what you are looking for, then feel free to check out that package instead for some more high-level features.
