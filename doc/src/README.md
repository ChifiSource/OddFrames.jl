## Welcome to OddFrames.jl
OddFrames is a new type of data-management framework that holds
a core methodology in a paradigm-less world. The framework contains
all you need to manipulate, extract, clean, and work with data.
The great thing about this library is that due to the fact
this is Julia, the types integrate really well with the base.
As a result, there really is often not much need for data-types
that are not as flexible as the base types. OddFrames follows the
following methodology:
- Paradigm should be based on functionality.
- Everything should be extendable.
- Immutability and Mutability should be managed.
- Data stored for values should be kept minimal.
- Boolean, and multiple types of indexing and methods should be used to control data.
- Data should be manipulated both as a multi-dimensional array AND a vector of 1-dimensional features.
- Data should align with default mathematical functions.
- Function calls should be consistent and versatile, no matter the type.
- The user should always be in control of the types defined in their current environment.
