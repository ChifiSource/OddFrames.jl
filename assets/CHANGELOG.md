### Labels - Bug fix - TODO - New Feature - Not Implemented - TODO C (TODO Carryover)
#### 0.0.8 Wrapping & testing
This new update is going to focus on the last few pieces that this package needs to implement to get going. As a result, it will be reserved to the TODOs that exist here and now, as well as bug fixes that might hinder doing  these TODOS. That being said, 0.0.9 will basically be a " finishing touches" update to ensure everything is up to speed for a release.

- **TODO C** Add ! for mutating methods **DONE**
- Added immutableoddframe with tuples and an immutable type.
- Added length(), size(), and width() bindings
